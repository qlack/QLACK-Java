/**
 * 23/01/2018 : atches documents that have fields matching a wildcard expression (not analyzed).
 * Supported wildcards are *, which matches any character sequence (including the empty one), and ?,
 * which matches any single character. Note this query can be slow, as it needs to iterate over many
 * terms. In order to prevent extremely slow wildcard queries, a wildcard term should not start with
 * one of the wildcards * or ?. In addition to the simple Query String we search directly in the
 * nested objects. This will additional return a inner_hits Object that contains the Id's for the
 * matched nested terms/objects.
 *
 * <pre>
 * new QueryWildcard()
 * 		.setTerm("searchField", "searchTermWildcard*", "NestedObjectName", "idOfMatchedNestedObject"))
 * 		.setIndex("foo")
 * 		.setType("FooBarDTO")
 * 		.setPageSize(10)
 * 		.setStartRecord(0)
 * 		.setExplain(false);
 * </pre>
