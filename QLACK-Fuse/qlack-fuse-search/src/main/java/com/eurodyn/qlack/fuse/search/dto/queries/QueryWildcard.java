 * Matches documents that have fields matching a wildcard expression (not analyzed). Supported wildcards are *, which matches any character
 * sequence (including the empty one), and ?, which matches any single character. Note this query can be slow, as it needs to iterate over
 * many terms. In order to prevent extremely slow wildcard queries, a wildcard term should not start with one of the wildcards * or ?.
