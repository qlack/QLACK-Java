QLACK is an ecosystem of software development libraries and utilities, targeting Java and Angular developers. Our goal
while developing QLACK is not to create a framework but to bundle together functionality we often use in projects under
a common roof.

QLACK has a rich history as in one form or another has been in development for more than 10 years. It initially started
as QLACK 1 based on Enterprise Java Beans technology, it continued with QLACK 2 based on OSGi, and currently on version
3 is based on Spring Boot.

Using QLACK you can accelerate your Spring Boot-based development as a considerable amount of boilerplate code is
already provided via QLACK's rich modules ecosystem and APIs.

QLACK is an Open Source project under EUPL.
